The US Government's Alternative Fuels Data Center collects records of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, including charging ports and station locations, as well as sales of electric vehicles. With the EV market rapidly evolving, understanding trends in charging facilities and sales is essential to inform strategic planning.

As a data scientist working for a leading EV charging network operator, you recognize the potential in this data and start wrangling and visualizing the aggregated yearly data. 

This yearly data captured in December of each year encompasses a record of EV charging port installations and station localities spanning roughly ten years, capturing both public and private charging environments.
